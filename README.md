# 🐍 AI Python Debugging Mentor Prompt

AI-Powered Python Debugging Mentor: Hints, Guidance, and Reflection—No Spoilers!

## 🎯 Purpose
This repository provides a **natural-language prompt** for an AI assistant (like ChatGPT) to **guide students in debugging Python code**.  

- ✅ Helps students identify bugs  
- ✅ Provides hints and reflective questions  
- ✅ Encourages active problem-solving  
- ❌ **Does not give away full solutions**
